You can use the search bar to search through the adverbials in a corpus. By default, you will be searching through all fields, but you can also select specific fields to search through.

You can type in multiple query terms. For example, if you type in `marie schrijft`, you will search for adverbials that contain `marie` and/or `schrijft`. By default the search will combine all terms using `OR`. This means that when you type: `Marie schrijft`, adverbials will be found containing one or more of these terms.

If you want to search for fields containing both terms, search for `Marie & schrijft` where `&` is used to show that both parts should be in the field. It is also possible to search for specific phrases by surround them with `"` such as `"schrijft netjes"`. This is relevant when you don't want to match texts containing all the words but having additional words in between e.g. `schrijft het netjes`.
